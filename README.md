# Automatic-Water-Refiller-usin-Arduino-UNO
•  Developed an Arduino UNO system using an ultrasonic distance sensor to auto-refill water coolers when levels dropped below 35%

•  Eliminated frequent manual intervention by automating water refills through a sensor-controlled motor linked to the main water supply

•  Programmed and integrated precise sensor-motor logic in Arduino IDE, enabling reliable and low-cost automation for daily use

•  Calibrated the refill system to ensure 95%+ sensor accuracy and consistent motor control across 10+ refill cycles with no wastage
